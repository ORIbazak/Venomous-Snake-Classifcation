# Venomous-Snake-Classifcation
Teaching a machine to classify between venomous and non- venomous snakes.


inside the ipynb file , there is a url for the dataset. downloading the dataset is mandatory to run the project. I highly recommned running the project on "Google Colaboratory" to improve performence, to not run the whole project at once as the project uses a lot of RAM.  (link to colab added at the start)
